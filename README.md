## Overview

Blackjack Game Simulator

The purpose of this project is to create a Blackjack card game simulator. The project is designed to have a computer user (player) and the computer (dealer) as participants. The user follows prompts to play the game, choosing from options listed at each turn. The computer makes decisions at each turn based on program logic.

## Lessons Learned

This project is challenging for me for two reasons: one, I have never played Blackjack before; two, I am still in the process acquiring basic object oriented programming skills and knowledge. 

I have not yet achieved working code for this project despite many hours of work. I am having difficulty with object oriented design and knowing how to access data/objects and use them throughout the program.
