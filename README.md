## Blackjack Project

### Week 4 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview

Blackjack Game Simulator

The purpose of this project is to create a Blackjack card game simulator. The project is designed to have a computer user (the player) and the computer (the dealer) as participants. The user follows prompts to play the game, choosing from options listed at each turn. The computer makes decisions at each turn based on program logic. The logic and turns used in this program simulate the most basic Blackjack rules.

## Lessons Learned

This project was challenging for me for two reasons: one, I have never played Blackjack before; two, I am still in the process acquiring basic object-oriented programming skills and knowledge. 

I have achieved working code for this project, but there are a lot of improvements that could be made. This project will probably be one that I will revisit in the future as I gain more experience and knowledge. A big challenge for me at the moment is properly using objects and methods that I have created throughout their associated classes. I also struggled for a bit on this project trying to make a "while" loop work in my playBlackJack method without causing errors. 

## Class Structure Used

I divided the project into four packages: one package for the app to run the program; one package for the Card and Deck classes, with Rank and Suit functioning in the package as enum for the Card class; one package for participants, with the Dealer class being an extension of the Player class; and one package for turns (hands), with the BlackjackHand class extending the Hand class.
