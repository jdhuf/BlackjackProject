## Blackjack Project

### Week 4 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview

Blackjack Game Simulator

The purpose of this project is to create a Blackjack card game simulator. The project is designed to have a computer user (player) and the computer (dealer) as participants. The user follows prompts to play the game, choosing from options listed at each turn. The computer makes decisions at each turn based on program logic. The logic and turns used in this simulator are simulate Blackjack rules but are far from 100% accurate.

## Technologies/Skills Used

## Lessons Learned

This project was challenging for me for two reasons: one, I have never played Blackjack before; two, I am still in the process acquiring basic object oriented programming skills and knowledge. 

I have achieved working code for this project, but there are a lot of improvements that could be made. This project will probably be one that I will revisit in the future as I gain more experience and knowledge. A big challenge for me at the moment is properly using objects and methods that I have created in the classes that I have created.
